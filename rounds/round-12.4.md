Round: rust-agent/12.4

This round: item 12.4 of the plan "Rewrite `bin/agent` in Rust" — this item only. Its full text, with its
expected result and its checks, is under "This round's item". The rules below hold for every round. The overview at
the end lists the other items for context only: do not do their work, and do not start a later item.

Ground rules

- Each role is given its own rules (the developer rules to write code, the review rules to review it); they are
  binding, and their rule IDs (ERR-2, PR-1, ...) are the ones this plan cites.
- Size, relaxed for this plan: the new `agent` is needed fast, so PR-1's limit is 5000 changed lines per PR, tests
  not counted, and PR-2's threshold for planning a split is about 4000. Everything else in PR-1 and PR-2 applies as
  written: how lines are counted, a ceiling not a target, never fewer tests because of it. Task 1.1 records this in
  `AGENTS.md`, which the reviewers read first. An item that would exceed the limit is split before coding and the
  split is recorded in the PR.
- Every item ends with its expected result (the files it creates or changes, what it adds, its tests, and why)
  and its checks (what anyone can run or look at to see that it works, and what they should see). The PR
  description quotes the item in full under `## Task`; the reviewers check the PR against it and run its checks.
  A file outside the expected list, an expected part left out, or a check that cannot pass yet needs its reason in
  the PR description.
- Each round is started with its own file, `rounds/round-N.M.md`: its `Round:` line, this round's item in full, these
  rules, and an overview of the other items, which are context only.
- Every item compiles and passes the gate on `main` without the other items of its feature. The gate is the
  repository's gate command and nothing more: here the Rust workspace's checks. The suites of the old
  implementation (its Bats and Go tests) are never run by a round, and a failure in them is not the round's
  business. An item uses only code from the features named in its feature's "Depends on" line, all of them merged.
  Items of one feature are taken in order; features whose dependencies are merged run in parallel.
- The old implementation — `bin/agent` (Bash), `agent/` (unfinished Go), `live/` (old dashboard) — is a reference
  for "how it worked" only. Nothing is ported line by line, linked, called or kept compatible: no shared files, no
  shared state format, no shared commands. `agentbus/` (Go) stays and is used as it is.
- English everywhere: code, comments, docs, commit messages, PR descriptions.
- No prompt text in `.rs` files, ever. Everything a model reads, and everything written into a file a human answers
  (questions-file instructions, notification texts), lives in `prompts/` as a template with `{{name}}` variables.
  Error messages of the CLI and log events stay in code.
- Async with `tokio`. No external process except: the model CLIs (`claude`, `codex`, `agy`, `opencode`), `git`,
  `agentbus`, the repository's own gate command, the configured notification command and the configured editor.
  Everything the Bash version did with `sed`, `awk`, `jq`, `grep`, `flock`, `gh` or `tailscale` is done natively.
- Approved dependencies (others need a DEP-1 justification): `tokio`, `tokio-util`, `clap`, `serde`, `serde_json`,
  `toml`, `thiserror`, `tracing`, `tracing-subscriber`, `tempfile`, `rustix`, `reqwest` (rustls), `axum`,
  `notify`, `rand`, `time`, `strum` (`derive`), `rusqlite` (`bundled`; the history, from item 8.4).
- An enum with a text form (a keyword enum: a CLI kind, a status, a verdict) takes it from `strum` derives: each text
  declared once, in a `#[strum(...)]` attribute. No hand-written text tables, no macro of our own for it.
- New code is developed and tested against a separate `AGENTS_HOME`; nothing here may touch the live `~/agents` of
  the running Bash harness until feature 10.
- The items of rounds, of the history and of checkpoints (8.3 to 8.8, 11.1, 12.1 to 12.4) are tested harder than
  the developer rules ask: a log that is wrong is worse than no log, and a takeover that is wrong loses work.
  - End to end: every record and every query is proved by a run of the daemon with fake CLIs and a fake GitHub
    server, read back through the reading API or `agent log`. Rows a test inserts by hand prove a query, never the
    recording.
  - Both sides of every rule: the case that satisfies it and the nearest one that does not. An invariant is refused
    by the API and again when read.
  - Every failure the item names is provoked — a killed daemon, a file that cannot be written, a full queue, a newer
    schema, a restart in the middle — and the test shows the work going on and the failure reported.
  - What holds for every input (a round trip, a sum, an order) is tested with generated inputs from a seeded source;
    the failure message gives the seed.
  - What a human reads is pinned in golden files, IDs and times normalised.
  - No secret reaches the history or the log: a test runs a round with marker values for the secrets and searches
    the bytes of the database for them.
  - Time comes from the injected clock, never from sleeping (TDD-8).
  - The PR description maps every sentence of the item that states a behaviour to the test that proves it (`## Tests`,
    a table: behaviour, test). A behaviour without a test is a finding.
  - The reviewers break three behaviours of the PR, not one (the review rules, step 6), at least one of them in what
    is recorded.

Target layout

    Cargo.toml                  workspace
    crates/agent-core/          pure: identifiers, configuration, state, task list, decisions, protocol types
    crates/agent-runtime/       effects: state store, processes, git, GitHub API, agentbus, prompts, notifications
    crates/agent/               the `agent` binary: CLI commands and `agent daemon`
    crates/agent-web/           the `agent-web` binary: dashboard (axum, htmx, server-sent events)
    prompts/clarification.md
    prompts/agent/, prompts/worker-agent/, prompts/investigator/   each role's rules (in the prompt catalog)
    prompts/harness/<module>/<name>.md     texts the harness composes (run prompts, questions files, notifications)
    config/agents.example.toml, config/systemd/
    docs/architecture.md, docs/configuration.md, docs/state.md, docs/task-list.md, docs/history.md, docs/log.md

Process model: `agent daemon` (a systemd user service) is the only owner of the state and of every model run. Every
other command — `agent run`, `answer`, `status`, `stop`, `gate`, ... — and the dashboard are clients of its Unix
socket. One owner, no file races (CON-3). The history database has one writer too, the daemon; `agent log` reads it
directly, so it works when the daemon does not.

Behaviour in short

- `agent run <agents...> "tasks" | -f tasks.md [--coordinator NAME] [--no-merge]`: one agent is a solo task, more
  than one is a team. `--autopilot` is the default: PR → two reviews → merge → next item; `--no-merge` stops before
  the merge and hands the PR to the human.
- Coordinator: an explicit `Coordinator: NAME` line at the top of the task list or `--coordinator` wins; otherwise an
  investigator in the team (randomly among two or more); otherwise a random normal agent. Workers never coordinate.
- An investigator coordinating weaker models leads them: explains, shows the way, and writes or fixes code itself
  when needed.
- The daemon assigns items, one to each normal member at a time. Workers do not take items: they serve `delegate`
  requests, the first free worker in the configured order.
- The coordinator integrates a member's branch, gets the gate green and opens the PR. The next item of a feature
  starts when the previous one is merged (with `--no-merge`: approved by both reviews).
- Every PR gets two reviews from investigators outside the team. A team that leaves fewer than two configured
  investigators outside it is refused at start: "too many investigators in the team". "Changes requested" goes back
  to the team at most 5 times; after that the human is asked.
- A team and a round are things with an ID (`team-…`, `round-…`): a round is one item of a team's list from its
  start to its merge. What happens — who was chosen and how, every prompt, every step and change of every run, the
  pull request and its reviews, the daemon's own log — is recorded under those two IDs in the history, an SQLite
  database, and read with `agent log`. The state file stays the one place for what is; the history is what happened.
- Work that is interrupted is taken up where it stands. A run that used up its turns is resumed, not failed. A
  round outlives its team: `agent run --continue <round>` gives it to a new team, in the same worktrees. Every task
  keeps a plan in its worktree — to do, in hand, done — that the harness reads and enforces; a task whose agent is
  gone is taken over by a free agent of the right tier on another account, who gets a briefing made from the
  history and the plan. `agent status <round>` shows each task's checkpoint as `OPEN`, `BUSY` or `CLOSED`.

Checkpoints for the human, between features (the agents do not run these):

- After feature 2: read `docs/configuration.md` and `docs/state.md`. The configuration and the state decided there
  are expensive to change later.
- After feature 7: a trial on a scratch repository with fake CLIs and a separate `AGENTS_HOME`: a solo task and a
  team from a two-item list, one question answered, one stop and resume.
- After item 8.3: read `docs/state.md` again: version 2 of the state and of the protocol, and the round.
- After item 8.4: read `docs/history.md` and ask the database of one round with `sqlite3`. The schema of the history
  is expensive to change later.
- After feature 8, before feature 10: a real run with cheap models on a toy repository and a separate
  `AGENTS_HOME`, in the default `--autopilot`: from a two-item list to two merged PRs. Then `agent log --round` of
  each: the story is whole — the task, who was chosen and how, every prompt, every step, every change, both
  reviews — and `agent log --level warn` shows nothing unexplained. The cutover starts only after it passes.
- After feature 9: the dashboard opened through `tailscale serve` from another device: the teams listed, a question
  answered, a team paused and resumed.
- After item 12.1: stop a real solo task in the middle of its work and continue its round with another agent: it
  works in the same worktree and its first message shows that it knows what was done.
- After item 12.3: read the `provider` and `account` of every agent in the live `agents.toml`; they decide who may
  stand in for whom.

Out of scope for this plan: remote nodes and the lead, investigation teams with phases and standalone investigation
requests, `agent live`, archiving, the cost of tokens in money, moving the state file into the database, choosing
agents by the quota their accounts have left (load balancing), automatic PR size limits (reviewers check PR-1), a
proof by the harness that a RED commit fails (a reviewer runs one, TDD-1), an `agentbus` socket API (it is called
as a process).

This round's item

12. Checkpoints
Depends on: 10 (merged before this round)
[ ] 12.4 Checkpoints of reviewers and workers
    The two roles outside the crew's own work get the same safety, each in its own way.
    A reviewer keeps a plan like any task (12.2) — its stages are review passes, its steps the steps of its review
    rules — and writes what it finds as it goes into `.agent/findings.md`, in the form of its report's findings. A
    reviewer that is gone (12.3) is replaced by another investigator of the configuration that is free, outside
    the team, not the other reviewer of the pull request and not on an exhausted account; with none, the review
    waits as it does today. The new reviewer takes the task and its worktree and gets the findings so far as leads:
    it checks each one itself and reads the whole diff again — the steps the reviewer before marked done are shown
    and are not taken as done, because a review is one mind over the whole change. Its plan starts anew.
    `reviewer` and `worker` join `[plan] roles` and its default.
    A worker's request that was being served when its worker went (a failed run, a provider that refuses, a
    daemon that stopped) goes back to the queue with its checkpoint: the task with its worktree, the snapshot, the
    plan. It is taken by a free worker drawn at random among those of another provider, and among those of the same
    provider only when there is no other; the new worker takes the task as in 12.1. The request is answered once,
    by whoever finishes it, and the requester is told who that was.
    Expected result:
    - Files: the reviewer's plan and findings in `crates/agent-core/src/plan.rs` and `prompts/harness/plan/`, the
      decisions for reviewers and workers in `crates/agent-core/src/decide/takeover.rs`, the requests in
      `crates/agent/src/daemon/team/`, the reviews in `crates/agent/src/daemon/owner/rounds/`, the texts in
      `prompts/harness/takeover/`, `docs/architecture.md`.
    - Adds: the reviewer's plan and findings file; the takeover of a review with findings as leads; the return of
      a worker's request to the queue with its checkpoint; the draw of a worker by provider.
    - Tests: the ground rule on testing these items applies. The decisions: tables — a reviewer replaced, the
      other reviewer never chosen, an investigator of the team never chosen, an exhausted account never chosen,
      none free; a worker of another provider drawn (seeded), the same provider only without another, none free.
      End to end with fake CLIs and the fake GitHub server: a reviewer whose fake CLI wrote two findings and
      failed is replaced; the new reviewer's prompt holds both findings as leads and the instruction to read the
      whole diff, its plan has no step done, and its verdict closes the review pass; the review pass keeps its
      number and names both reviewers; a worker killed in the middle of a request: the request is served by a
      worker of the other provider in the same worktree, answered once, and the requester's message names it; a
      daemon stopped while a request is served returns the request at its start (the known limit of 7.1 is gone).
    - Why: a review or a request cut off in the middle costs its whole time again, and until now a request in
      hand was lost with the daemon.
    Checks:
    - With fake CLIs: a reviewer that fails after writing a finding is replaced and the second reviewer's prompt
      shows that finding under leads; the pull request still gets two verdicts.
    - A worker's request whose worker is killed is finished by a worker of another provider; `agent log --round
      <id>` shows both runs and one answer.
